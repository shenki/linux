Device-tree bindings for P9 SBEFIFO CFAM device
-----------------------------------------------

Required properties:
 - compatible = "ibm,p9-sbefifo";
 - reg = < address size >;		: FSI CFAM address for the SBE engine
					  and address space size.
 - #address-cells = <1>;		: Number of address cells in child
					  nodes.
 - #size-cells = <0>;			: Number of size cells in child nodes.

Optional properties:
 - <child nodes>			: Devices that are accessible through
					  the SBEFIFO. Child nodes are "opaque"
					  to the SBEFIFO; the SBEFIFO needs no
					  information about a child node other
					  than if it exists or not.

Child node optional properties:
 - compatible = "dts-name"
 - reg = < address >;			: Meaningful only for the child node

Examples:

    sbefifo@2400 {
        compatible = "ibm,p9-sbefifo";
        reg = < 0x2400 0x400 >;
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;

        occ@1 {
            compatible = "ibm,p9-occ";
            reg = < 1 >;
        };
    };
