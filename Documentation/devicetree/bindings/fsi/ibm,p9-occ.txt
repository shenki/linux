Device-tree bindings for P9 On-Chip Controller
----------------------------------------------

The POWER9 On-Chip Controller is accessed through the SBEFIFO. All OCC nodes
must be child nodes of SBEFIFO devices (see ibm,p9-sbefifo.txt).

Required properties:
 - compatible = "ibm,p9-occ";

Optional properties:
 - reg = <processor index>;	: Index for the processor this OCC is on.

Examples:

    occ@1 {
        compatible = "ibm,p9-occ";
        reg = <1>;
    };
