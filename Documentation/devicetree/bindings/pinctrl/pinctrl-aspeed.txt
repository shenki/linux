Aspeed Pin Controllers
----------------------

The Aspeed SoCs vary in functionality inside a generation but have a common mux
device register layout.

Required properties:
- compatible : should be one of the following:
		"aspeed,ast2400-pinctrl"
		"aspeed,g4-pinctrl";
		"aspeed,ast2500-pinctrl"
		"aspeed,g5-pinctrl"

The pin controller node should be a child of a syscon node with the required
property:
- compatible: "syscon", "simple-mfd"

Refer to the the bindings described in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/syscon.txt

Subnode Format
--------------

The required properties of child nodes are (as defined in pinctrl-bindings):
- function
- groups

Each function has only one associated pin group. Each group is named by its
function. The following values for the function and groups properties are
supported:

aspeed,ast2400-pinctrl, aspeed,g4-pinctrl:

  ACPI BMCINT DDCCLK DDCDAT FLACK FLBUSY FLWP GPID0 GPIE0 I2C3 I2C4 I2C5 I2C6

Examples:

syscon: scu@1e6e2000 {
	compatible = "syscon", "simple-mfd";
	reg = <0x1e6e2000 0x1a8>;

	pinctrl: pinctrl@1e6e2000 {
		compatible = "aspeed,g4-pinctrl";

		pinctrl_i2c3_default: i2c3_default {
			function = "I2C3";
			groups = "I2C3";
		};
	};
};

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices.
