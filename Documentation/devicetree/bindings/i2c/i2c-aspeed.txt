Device tree configuration for the I2C controller and busses on the AST24XX
and AST25XX SoCs.

Controller:

	Required Properties:
	- #address-cells	: should be 1
	- #size-cells 		: should be 1
	- #interrupt-cells 	: should be 1
	- compatible 		: should be "aspeed,ast2400-i2c-controller"
				  or "aspeed,ast2500-i2c-controller"
	- reg			: address start and range of controller
	- ranges		: defines address offset and range for busses
	- interrupts		: interrupt number
	- clocks		: root clock of bus, should reference the APB
				  clock
	- clock-ranges		: specifies that child busses can inherit clocks
	- interrupt-controller	: denotes that the controller receives and fires
				  new interrupts for child busses

Bus:

	Required Properties:
	- #address-cells	: should be 1
	- #size-cells		: should be 0
	- reg			: address offset and range of bus
	- compatible		: should be "aspeed,ast2400-i2c-bus"
				  or "aspeed,ast2500-i2c-bus"
	- interrupts		: interrupt number

	Optional Properties:
	- clock-frequency	: frequency of the bus clock in Hz
				  defaults to 100 kHz when not specified

Example:

i2c: i2c@1e78a000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	#interrupt-cells = <1>;

	compatible = "aspeed,ast2400-i2c-controller";
	reg = <0x1e78a000 0x40>;
	ranges = <0 0x1e78a000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <12>;
	clocks = <&clk_apb>;
	clock-ranges;
	interrupt-controller;

	i2c0: i2c-bus@40 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x40 0x40>;
		compatible = "aspeed,ast2400-i2c-bus";
		clock-frequency = <100000>;
		status = "disabled";
		interrupts = <0>;
		interrupt-parent = <&i2c>;
	};
};
