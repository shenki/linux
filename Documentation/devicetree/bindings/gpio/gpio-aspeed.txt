Aspeed GPIO controller Device Tree Bindings
-------------------------------------------

Required properties:
- #gpio-cells 		: Should be two
			  - First cell is the GPIO line number
			  - Second cell is used to specify optional
			    parameters (unused)

- compatible		: Either "aspeed,ast2400-gpio" or "aspeed,ast2500-gpio"

- reg			: Address and length of the register set for the device
- gpio-controller	: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
- interrupts		: Interrupt specifier (see interrupt bindings for
			  details)

Optional properties:
- interrupt-controller	: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
- interrupt-parent	: The parent interrupt controller, optional if inherited
- #interrupt-cells 	: Should be 2.  The first cell is the GPIO number.
			  The second cell bits[3:0] is used to specify trigger
			  type and level flags:
			      1 = low-to-high edge triggered.
			      2 = high-to-low edge triggered.
			      4 = active high level-sensitive.
			      8 = active low level-sensitive.

The gpio and interrupt properties are further described in their respective
bindings documentation:

- Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt
- Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

  Example:
	gpio@1e780000 {
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		compatible = "aspeed,ast2400-gpio"
		gpio-controller;
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = <20>;
		reg = <0x1e780000 0x1000>;
	};
