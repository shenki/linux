Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Maxim MAX31785 chip.

The MAX31785 controls the speeds of up to six fans using six independent
PWM outputs. The desired fan speeds (or PWM duty cycles) are written
through the I2C interface. The outputs drive "4-wire" fans directly,
or can be used to modulate the fan's power terminals using an external
pass transistor.

Tachometer inputs monitor fan tachometer logic outputs for precise (+/-1%)
monitoring and control of fan RPM as well as detection of fan failure.


Sysfs entries
-------------

fan[1-6]_input           RO  fan tachometer speed in RPM
fan[1-6]_fault           RO  fan experienced fault
fan[1-6]_pulses          RW  tachometer pulses per fan revolution
fan[1-6]_target          RW  desired fan speed in RPM
pwm[1-6]_enable          RW  pwm mode, 0=disabled, 1=pwm, 2=rpm, 3=automatic
pwm[1-6]                 RW  fan target duty cycle (0-255)

Dynamic sysfs entries
--------------------

Whether these entries are present depends on the firmware features detected on
the device during probe.

fan[1-6]_input_fast      RO  fan tachometer speed in RPM (fast rotor measurement)
