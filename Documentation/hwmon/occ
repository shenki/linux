Kernel driver occ-hwmon
=======================

Supported chips:
  * POWER8
  * POWER9

Author: Eddie James <eajames@us.ibm.com>

Description
-----------

This driver supports hardware monitoring for the On-Chip Controller (OCC)
embedded on POWER processors. The OCC is a device that collects and aggregates
sensor data from the processor and the system. The OCC can provide the raw
sensor data as well as perform thermal and power management on the system.

The P8 version of this driver is a client driver of I2C. It may be probed
manually if an "ibm,p8-occ-hwmon" compatible device is found under the
appropriate I2C bus node in the device-tree.

The P9 version of this driver is a client driver of the FSI-based OCC driver.
It will be probed automatically by the FSI-based OCC driver. Please see the
device-tree bindings documentation for that driver for details on probing
an OCC device (Documentation/devicetree/bindings/fsi/ibm,p9-occ.txt).
