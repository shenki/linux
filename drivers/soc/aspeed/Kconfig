	default ARCH_ASPEED
	help
	  Control LPC firmware cycle mappings through ioctl()s. The driver
	  also provides a read/write interface to a BMC ram region where the
	  host LPC read/write region can be buffered.

config ASPEED_LPC_SNOOP
	tristate "ASPEED LPC snoop support"
	select REGMAP
	select MFD_SYSCON
	default ARCH_ASPEED
	help
	  Provides a driver to control the LPC snoop interface which
	  allows the BMC to listen on and save the data written by
	  the host to an arbitrary LPC I/O port.

config ASPEED_MCTP
	tristate "Aspeed ast2600 MCTP Controller support"
	depends on REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON
	help
	  Enable support for ast2600 MCTP Controller.
	  The MCTP controller allows the BMC to communicate with devices on
	  the host PCIe network.

config ASPEED_UART_ROUTING
	tristate "ASPEED uart routing control"
	select REGMAP
	select MFD_SYSCON
	default ARCH_ASPEED
	help
	  Provides a driver to control the UART routing paths, allowing
	  users to perform runtime configuration of the RX muxes among
	  the UART controllers and I/O pins.

config ASPEED_LPC_MAILBOX
	tristate "ASPEED LPC mailbox support"
	select REGMAP
	select MFD_SYSCON
	default ARCH_ASPEED
	help
	  Provides a driver to control the LPC mailbox which possesses
	  up to 32 data registers for the communication between the Host
	  and the BMC over LPC.

	select REGMAP
	select MFD_SYSCON
	depends on HAS_DMA
	help
	  Enable support for the XDMA Engine found on the ASPEED BMC
	  SoCs. The XDMA engine can perform PCIe DMA operations between the BMC
	  and a host processor.

config ASPEED_SBC
	bool "ASPEED Secure Boot Controller driver"

	help
	  Enable driver support for the Aspeed eSPI engine. The eSPI engine
	  plays as a slave device in BMC to communicate with the Host over
	  the eSPI interface. The four eSPI channels, namely peripheral,
	  virtual wire, out-of-band, and flash are supported.

config AST2500_ESPI
	tristate
	depends on ASPEED_ESPI

config ASPEED_LPC_PCC
	tristate "Aspeed Post Code Capture support"
	depends on ARCH_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON
	help
	  Provides a driver to control the LPC PCC interface,
	  allowing the BMC to snoop data bytes written by the
	  the host to an arbitrary LPC I/O port.

config ASPEED_UDMA
	tristate "Aspeed UDMA Engine Driver"
	depends on ARCH_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON && HAS_DMA
	help
	  Enable support for the Aspeed UDMA Engine found on the Aspeed AST2XXX
	  SOCs. The UDMA engine can perform UART DMA operations between the memory
	  buffer and the UART/VUART devices.
