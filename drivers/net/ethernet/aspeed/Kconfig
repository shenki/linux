config NET_VENDOR_AST
	bool "AST devices"

	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Faraday cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

          This driver supports the ASPEED Gigabit Ethernet controller.

	help
	  This driver supports the FTGMAC100 Gigabit Ethernet controller
	  from Faraday. It is used on Faraday A369, Andes AG102 and some
	  other ARM/NDS32 SoC's.
