	help
	  This provides basic core functionality support for JTAG class devices.
	  Hardware that is equipped with a JTAG microcontroller can be
	  supported by using this driver's interfaces.
	  This driver exposes a set of IOCTLs to the user space for
	  the following commands:
	    SDR: Performs an IEEE 1149.1 Data Register scan
	    SIR: Performs an IEEE 1149.1 Instruction Register scan.
	    RUNTEST: Forces the IEEE 1149.1 bus to a run state for a specified
	    number of clocks or a specified time period.

	  If you want this support, you should say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called jtag.
